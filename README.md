# Mission of CodeVerde Project

The mission of CodeVerde is to empower developers to build scalable, maintainable, and modular systems by bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application of architectural principles and design patterns.

By providing clear examples, reusable templates, and intuitive tools, CodeVerde aims to simplify complex design challenges, foster best practices, and inspire innovation.  Our goal is to build a go-to resource that helps developers of all skill levels to craft clean,
efficient, and future-proof codebases.

Feel free to contribute or share your thoughts! Together, we can advance the art of software design and make complex systems simpler and more accessible for everyone.

# Living Projects:

## MeiAnalytics

**MeiAnalytics** is a lightweight and flexible analytics framework for tracking user interactions, 
events, and custom metrics in iOS applications. 

### 1. Features

- **Event Tracking**: Track custom events and user interactions with ease.
- **Session Management**: Measure the duration of sessions, screen views, and actions.
- **Configurable Logging**: Dynamically enable or disable logging as needed.
- **High Performance**: Process and send events to the server in background process.
- **Reliability**: Unprocessed events are persisted locally to prevent data loss.

### 2. Installation

To integrate MeiAnalytics with Swift Package Manager:

2.1. In Xcode, Add 'MeiAnalytics' project to your workspace
2.2. Under your application project **General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**. 
2.3. Add MeiAnalytics.framework.

### 3. Usage

#### 3.1. Importing MeiAnalytic

Import MeiAnalytics in your Swift files:

```swift
import MeiAnalytics
```

#### 3.2. Basic Setup

Enable Tracking if needed:

```swift

MeiAnalytics.shared.isEnabled = true

```

#### 3.3. Tracking Events

All analytics events are associated with a custom event type and optionally some additional properties. When an event's log method is called, its timestamp and duration are recorded, creating a snapshot for further background processing. The framework will periodically send events to the server when the device is connected to the network. Any unprocessed events are saved in NSUserDefaults to preserve data in case the application restarts.

The framework supports the following two types of events:

* ImmediateEvent - an event occurs instantly and is recorded at a single point in time.
* DurationEvent - an event with a measurable duration, tracking both a start and end time.

```swift

enum SearchEvent: String {
    case searchInputFieldKeyPressed
    case searchViewInteraction
}

let searchInputFieldKeyPressedEvent = ImmediateEvent(type:SearchEvent.searchViewInteraction.rawValue)

searchInputFieldKeyPressedEvent.log()

let searchViewInteractionEvent = DurationEvent(type:SearchEvent.searchViewInteraction.rawValue)
searchViewInteractionEvent.start()
// do other stuff ...

searchViewInteractionEvent.log()

```

# General Design Concepts for iOS Applications

## Popular Architecture Patterns 

Here are some of the most popular software architecture patterns:

### 1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**
- **Reference**: [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/MVC.html) 

- **Description**: MVC is fundamental in Cocoa development, as it separates the app into three distinct roles: 
  - **Model**: Encapsulate app-specific data and define the business logic, including the processes for manipulating and managing that data.
  - **View**: Handle the visual representation and user interactions.  
  - **Controller**: Acts as the intermediary between the Model and View, interpreting user actions from the View and updating the Model accordingly.
- **Use Cases**: The foundation of many iOS frameworks such as UIKit.
- **Main Advantages**:
  - Simple to understand and implement.
  - Easy to integrate with other iOS frameworks.
  - Support parallel development as its modular approach allows clear task delegation
- **Main Challenges**:
  - Controllers can become overly complex (Massive View Controllers), leading to scalability limitations.
  - Lack of a clear standard implementation, resulting in inconsistencies.
  - Synchronizing the Model and View through the Controller can require considerable effort.
- **Key Historical Milestones**:
    - Origin: The concept was formulated by Trygve Reenskaug in 1970s at Xerox PARC.
    - Formal Introduction: Officially introduced in the early 1980s during the development of Smalltalk-80.
    - Adoption: Widely implemented in various frameworks and platforms, including: 
      - Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks by Apple.
      - Ruby on Rails for web development.
      - ASP.NET MVC for .NET applications.

### 2. **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**
- **Reference**: Apple doesn't provide an official reference for MVVM; however, it is widely used in the developer community due to its reactive and declarative nature.
- **Description**: Adds a **ViewModel** layer to mediate between the View and Model, handling data transformation and state management:
  - **Model**: Represents the application's data and encapsulates the business logic.
  - **View**: Represents the UI and is responsible for presenting data to the user.
  - **ViewModel**: Retrieves data from the Model, processes it for display in the View, handles user inputs from the View, updates the Model as needed, and manages the state of the App.
- **Use Cases**: Apps with complex UI bindings, often used with SwiftUI or RxSwift.
- **Main Advantages**:
    - Enhanced testability as the ViewModel is independent of the UI framework, making unit testing easier.
    - Improves code reusability since viewModels can be reused across multiple Views and platforms.
    - Seamless integration with declarative UI frameworks like SwiftUI and React.
- **Main Challenges**:
  - Additional abstraction layers can introduce performance penalties, affecting app responsiveness.
  - ViewModels can become bloated when too much logic is placed in them.
  - Platforms like iOS lack official MVVM frameworks, leading to potential inconsistencies in implementations.
- **Key Historical Milestones**:
    - Origin: Introduced by John Gossman in 2005 while working on Microsoftâ€™s WPF framework.
    - Adoption: Widely used with modern declarative UI frameworks: 
      - React
      - SwiftUI
      - Jetpack Compose (Android)
